# Unveiling Community Structures and Defection Trends in the US Senate

The United States Senate, a crucial arena for legislative decision-making, is characterized by intricate political dynamics shaped by party affiliations and ideological alignments. This study employs network analysis techniques to investigate community detection within the Senate, with a focus on understanding patterns of collaboration and defection among senators. Utilizing data spanning from 2019 to 2021 sourced from the US Congress (obtained by web scraping), including information on legislation, senators, roll call votes, and bill details, we apply the Louvain Walk clustering algorithm to partition senators into cohesive groups based on their voting behaviors and committee assignments.

Our analysis unveils distinct communities within the Senate, reflective of both party affiliations and ideological factions. Democrats tend to demonstrate higher intra-party cohesion, while Republicans exhibit more variability in their collaboration patterns. We identified instances of defection, where senators diverge from their party's stance on legislative matters, shedding light on the underlying motivations driving such behavior. Furthermore, we assessed the centrality of senators within their respective communities, providing insights into influential figures and their impact on legislative outcomes.

This study highlights the significance of community detection in deciphering the complex dynamics of the US Senate and its role in shaping legislative decision-making. Future research directions may include incorporating additional data sources and employing advanced analytical techniques to further elucidate the intricacies of political discourse within the Senate, offering valuable insights for policymakers and political analysts alike.
